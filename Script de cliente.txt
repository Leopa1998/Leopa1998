The session lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes. 
During this time client's artifact level was increased (+1). 
I have done several strikes and vendor bounties, and earned new gear, bright dust.
No more sessions expected.


I have finished your order. Your new artifact level is +19.
You are now able to do GMs. Remember that Palindrome is dropping this week and is no comming back after reset. If you want to get a god roll, you can check out this link: https://lfcarry.com/d2/the-palindrome
